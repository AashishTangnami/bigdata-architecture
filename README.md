I've created a comprehensive interactive visualization of the Hadoop HDFS architecture that breaks down the system to its core components step by step with explanation. Here's what the visualization includes:
Key Features:
1. **Master-Slave Architecture Visualization**
   * Interactive NameNode section showing its core responsibilities
   * DataNode grid with clickable blocks representing data storage
   * Visual representation of the distributed nature
2. **Block Replication Strategy**
   * Interactive demonstration of the default 3-replica placement policy
   * Shows how replicas are distributed across racks for fault tolerance
   * Explains the rack-aware placement algorithm
3. **Rack-Aware Architecture**
   * Visual representation of how nodes are organized in racks
   * Interactive nodes showing the network topology considerations
   * Demonstrates how HDFS optimizes for network bandwidth
4. **Interactive Information System**
   * Click on any component to get detailed explanations
   * Dynamic information panel that updates based on selections
   * Multiple control buttons for different aspects (Overview, Data Flow, Failure Handling, Performance)
5. **Animated Features**
   * Data flow animation showing how data moves through the system
   * Auto-demo mode for guided exploration
   * Pulse animations on blocks to show activity

Core HDFS Concepts Covered:
* **NameNode**: File system namespace management, metadata storage, block mapping
* **DataNodes**: Data storage, heartbeat monitoring, block replication
* **Block Management**: 128MB default size, replication factor, checksums
* **Fault Tolerance**: Heartbeat detection, automatic recovery, data integrity
* **Performance Optimization**: Streaming access, rack awareness, pipeline writes
* **Persistence**: FsImage and EditLog for metadata durability
The visualization is fully responsive and provides an intuitive way to understand how HDFS achieves its goals of reliability, scalability, and high throughput for big data applications. Users can explore the architecture at their own pace or use the auto-demo feature for a guided tour.
